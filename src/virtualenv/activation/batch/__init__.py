# cmd.exe's own command-line parser looks for these regardless of surrounding quotes: confirmed on a
# real Windows runner that `@set "VAR=x & cmd"` still runs `cmd` as a second statement even though the
# whole VAR=value expression is quoted. `(` and `)` are not in this set - confirmed on the same runner
# that `@set "VAR=C:\Program Files (x86)\..."` round-trips unchanged, since parentheses are only special
# to cmd.exe as block delimiters in control-flow syntax (if/for), not as bare characters in a value.
#
# `!` is only live when the caller already has delayed expansion enabled (`setlocal enabledelayedexpansion`,
# `cmd /V:ON`) - not cmd.exe's default, but confirmed on a real runner that a prompt like `foo!SECRET!`
# then substitutes the actual value of an existing SECRET variable into the prompt, so it is neutered
# unconditionally rather than only when that mode happens to be on. cmd.exe stops reading a line at Ctrl-Z
# (0x1A) - confirmed on a real runner that `@set "VAR=a<Ctrl-Z>b"` sets `a` and then runs `b"` as the next command.
