Improve base executable discovery mechanism:

- print at debug level why we refuse some candidates,
- when no candidates match exactly, instead of hard failing fallback to the closest match where the priority of
  matching attributes is: python implementation, major version, minor version, architecture, patch version,
  release level and serial.
