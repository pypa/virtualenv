Seed packages and new CLI parser:

    * Users can now better control the packages seeded into a new virtual environment (via the
      seed_packages config option, ``VIRTUALENV_SEED_PACKAGES`` env var, or -s append cli option).
      This allows you to specify exactly versions of the core packages (``pip``, ``setuptools`` and ``wheel``)
      or to add additional packages to seed. The pip used to install these packages is the current
      bundled pip version.

    * The CLI help now shows if an option is influenced by either the config file or environment variables,
      and shows clearly where the configuration file is read form.

Note you can use this to specify any PEP-508 compliant dependencies.
