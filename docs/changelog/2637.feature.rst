Add ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` environment variable support to all activation scripts (Bash, Batch, PowerShell, Fish, C Shell,
Nushell, and Python). The virtualenv's ``lib/pkgconfig`` directory is now automatically prepended to ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH``
on activation and restored on deactivation, enabling packages that use ``pkg-config`` during build/install to find their
configuration files - by :user:`rahuldevikar`.
