Migrate to a ``setup.cfg`` based build. Minimum ``setuptools`` required to build is ``setuptools >= 40.6.3``, this is automatically acquired for all PEP-518 builders (recommended), or acquired via the old ``setup_requires`` method otherwise. Move exclusively to a ``setuptools`` generated console entry point script, this now does make ``setuptools >= 18.0.0`` a runtime dependency (install requires). Source and issue tracker now is shown on PyPi (supplied as package metadata) beside the homepage.
