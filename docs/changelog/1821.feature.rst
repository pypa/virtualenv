Better handling of bundled wheel installation:

- display the installed seed package versions in the final summary output
- add a manual upgrade of embedded wheels feature via :option:`upgrade-embed-wheels` CLI flag
- periodically (once every 14 days) try to automatically upgrade the embedded wheels in the background, can be disabled
  via :option:`no-periodic-update`
