Store app data (pip/setuptools/wheel caches) under the OS cache directory (``platformdirs.user_cache_dir``) instead of
the data directory (``platformdirs.user_data_dir``). Existing app data at the old location is automatically migrated on
first use. This ensures cached files that can be redownloaded are placed in the standard cache location (e.g.
``~/.cache`` on Linux, ``~/Library/Caches`` on macOS) where they are excluded from backups and can be cleaned by system
tools - by :user:`rahuldevikar`. (:issue:`1884`)
