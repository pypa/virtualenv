Differences with venv
=====================
- is slower (by not having the app-data seed method),
- is not as extendable,
- cannot create virtual environments for arbitrarily installed python versions (and automatically discover these),
- is not upgrade-able via pip,
- does not have as rich programmatic API (describe virtual environments without creating them).
