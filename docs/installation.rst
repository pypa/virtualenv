Installation
============

via pipx
--------

:pypi:`virtualenv` is a CLI tool that needs a Python interpreter to run. If you already have a ``Python 3.5+``
interpreter the best is to use :pypi:`pipx` to install virtualenv into an isolated environment. This has the added
benefit that later you'll be able to upgrade virtualenv without affecting other parts of the system.

.. code-block:: console

    pipx install virtualenv
    virtualenv --help

via pip
-------

Alternatively you can install it within the global Python interpreter itself (perhaps as a user package via the
``--user`` flag). Be cautious if you are using a python install that is managed by your operating system or
another package manager. ``pip`` might not coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an
inconsistent state.

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install --user virtualenv
    python -m virtualenv --help

via zipapp
----------

You can use virtualenv without installing it too. We publish a Python
`zipapp <https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html>`_, you can just download this from
`https://bootstrap.pypa.io/virtualenv.pyz <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/virtualenv.pyz>`_ and invoke this package
with a python interpreter:

.. code-block:: console

    python virtualenv.pyz --help

The root level zipapp is always the current latest release. To get the last supported zipapp against a given python
minor release use the link ``https://bootstrap.pypa.io/virtualenv/x.y/virtualenv.pyz``, e.g. for the last virtualenv
supporting Python 2.7 use
`https://bootstrap.pypa.io/virtualenv/2.7/virtualenv.pyz <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/2.7/virtualenv/virtualenv.pyz>`_.

Python and OS Compatibility
---------------------------

virtualenv works with the following Python interpreter implementations:

- `CPython <https://www.python.org/>`_ versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
- `PyPy <https://pypy.org/>`_ 2.7 and 3.4+.

This means virtualenv works on the latest patch version of each of these minor versions. Previous patch versions are
supported on a best effort approach. virtualenv works on the following platforms:

- Unix/Linux,
- macOS,
- Windows.
