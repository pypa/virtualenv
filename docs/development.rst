Development
===========

Contributing
------------

Refer to the `pip development`_ documentation - it applies equally to
virtualenv, except that virtualenv issues should be filed on the `virtualenv
repo`_ at GitHub.

Virtualenv's release schedule is tied to pip's -- each time there's a new pip
release, there will be a new virtualenv release that bundles the new version of
pip.

Files in the ``virtualenv_embedded/`` subdirectory are embedded into
``virtualenv.py`` itself as base64-encoded strings (in order to support
single-file use of ``virtualenv.py`` without installing it). If your patch
changes any file in ``virtualenv_embedded/``, run ``bin/rebuild-script.py`` to
update the embedded version of that file in ``virtualenv.py``; commit that and
submit it as part of your patch / pull request.

Running the tests
-----------------

The easy way to run tests (handles test dependencies automatically, works with the ``sdist`` too)::

    $ tox

    Note you need to first install tox separately by using::

   $ python -m pip --user install -U tox

Run ``python -m tox -av`` for a list of all supported Python environments or just run the
tests in all of the available ones by running just ``tox``.
