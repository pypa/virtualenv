v16.2.0 (2018-12-31)
--------------------

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- ``copyfile`` handles relative symlinks and symlinks to symlinks, avoiding problems when Python was installed using ``stow`` or ``homebrew``. (`#268 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/268>`_)
- Fix preserving of original path when using fish and a subshell. (`#904 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/904>`_)

- ``lib64`` symlink is again relative (as was with ``< 16.1.0``). (`#1248 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1248>`_)


Features
^^^^^^^^

- ``fish`` version 3 support for the activation script. (`#1275 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1275>`_)
- ``powershell`` activator is no longer signed. (`#816 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/816>`_)
- ``pyproject.toml`` with ``PEP-517`` and ``PEP-518`` is now provided. ``tox.ini`` is now packaged with the ``sdist``. Distributions repackaging the library should use ``tox -e py`` to run the test suite on the ``sdist``. (`#909 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/909>`_)
- ``activate_this.py`` improvements: set ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` environment variable; ``pypy``, ``pypy3`` and ``jython`` support. (`#1057 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1057>`_)
- The `xonsh <http://xon.sh/index.html>`_ shell is now supported by generating the ``xon.sh`` activation script. (`#1206 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1206>`_)
- Support ``pip`` wheels with removed ``certifi's cacert.pem``. (`#1252 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1252>`_)
- Upgrade setuptools from ``40.5.0`` to ``40.6.3`` and wheel from ``0.32.2`` to ``0.32.3``. (`#1257 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1257>`_)
- ``powershell`` now also provides the ``pydoc`` function that uses the virtual environments ``pydoc``. (`#1258 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1258>`_)
- Migrate to a ``setup.cfg`` based build. Minimum ``setuptools`` required to build is ``setuptools >= 40.6.3``, this is automatically acquired for all PEP-518 builders (recommended), or acquired via the old ``setup_requires`` method otherwise. Move exclusively to a ``setuptools`` generated console entry point script, this now does make ``setuptools >= 18.0.0`` a runtime dependency (install requires). Source and issue tracker now is shown on PyPi (supplied as package metadata) beside the homepage. (`#1259 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1259>`_)


Deprecations (removal in next major release)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Using ``python setup.py test`` is now marked as deprecated and will be removed in next release. Use ``tox`` instead, always. (`#909 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/909>`_)
- Using the project directly from the source layout is now deprecated. Going ahead people wanting to use the project without installing the virtualenv are encouraged to download the wheel from PyPi and extract it to access the ``virtualenv.py`` file. We'll be switching to a ``src`` layout with next release. (`#1241 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1241>`_)
- No longer support ``distutils`` build/installation, now ``setuptools >= 40.6.3`` is required. (`#1259 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1259>`_)


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``activate_this.py`` recommend ``exec(open(this_file).read(), {'__file__': this_file})`` as it works both on Python 2 and 3. (`#1057 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1057>`_)
- Clarify how this project relates to the standard libraries ``venv`` and when one would still want to use this tool. (`#1086 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1086>`_)
- Move to a ``towncrier`` generated changelog to avoid merge conflicts, generate draft changelog documentation. Prefix version string in changelog with ``v`` to make the hyperlinks stable. (`#1234 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1234>`_)

  supported Python version is now Python 2.6.

* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Using ``virtualenv.py`` as an isolated script
  (i.e. without an associated ``virtualenv_support`` directory) is no longer
  supported for security reasons and will fail with an error.

  Along with this, ``--never-download`` is now always pinned to ``True``, and
  is only being maintained in the short term for backward compatibility
  (Pull #412).

* **IMPORTANT** Switched to the new setuptools (v0.9.7) which has been merged
  with Distribute_ again and works for Python 2 and 3 with one codebase.
  The ``--distribute`` and ``--setuptools`` options are now no-op.

* Updated to pip 1.4.

* Added support for PyPy3k

* Added ``--always-copy`` option to suppress use of symlinks (Pull #409)

* Added the option to use a version number with the ``-p`` option to get the
  system copy of that Python version (Windows only)

* Removed embedded ``ez_setup.py``, ``distribute_setup.py`` and
  ``distribute_from_egg.py`` files as part of switching to merged setuptools.

* Fixed ``--relocatable`` to work better on Windows.

* Fixed issue with readline on Windows.

.. _Distribute: https://pypi.org/project/distribute

v1.9.1 (2013-03-08)

* Made 64bit detection compatible with Python 2.5 (Pull #393).


v1.8.4 (2012-11-25)
-------------------

* Updated distribute to 0.6.31. This fixes #359 (numpy install regression) on
  UTF-8 platforms, and provides a workaround on other platforms:
  ``PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 pip install numpy``.

* When installing virtualenv via curl, don't forget to filter out arguments
  the distribute setup script won't understand. Fixes #358.

* Added some more integration tests.

* Removed the unsupported embedded setuptools egg for Python 2.4 to reduce
  file size.

v1.8.3 (2012-11-21)
-------------------

* Added ability to install distribute from a user-provided egg, rather than the
  bundled sdist, for better speed. Thanks Paul Moore.

  and more explicit about full paths. Fixes #334 and #330. Thanks Jeremy Orem.

* Give lib64 site-dir preference over lib on 64-bit systems, to avoid wrong
  32-bit compiles in the venv. Fixes #328. Thanks Damien Nozay.

* Fix a bug with prompt-handling in ``activate.csh`` in non-interactive csh
  shells. Fixes #332. Thanks Benjamin Root for report and patch.

* Make it possible to create a virtualenv from within a Python
  3.3. pyvenv. Thanks Chris McDonough for the report.

  distribute is the default (like in Debian).

v1.8.2 (2012-09-06)
-------------------

* Updated the included pip version to 1.2.1 to fix regressions introduced
  there in 1.2.

* Use ``/usr/bin/multiarch-platform`` if available to figure out the include
  directory. Thanks for the patch, Mika Laitio.

* Fix ``install_name_tool`` replacement to work on Python 3.X.

* Handle paths of users' site-packages on Mac OS X correctly when changing
  the prefix.

v1.7.2 (2012-06-22)
-------------------

* Updated to distribute 0.6.27.

* Fix activate.fish on OS X. Fixes #8. Thanks David Schoonover.

* Create a virtualenv-x.x script with the Python version when installing, so
  virtualenv for multiple Python versions can be installed to the same
  script location. Thanks Miki Tebeka.

* Restored ability to create a virtualenv with a path longer than 78
  characters, without breaking creation of virtualenvs with non-ASCII paths.
  Thanks, Bradley Ayers.

* Added ability to create virtualenvs without having installed Apple's
  developers tools (using an own implementation of ``install_name_tool``).
  Thanks Mike Hommey.

* Fixed PyPy and Jython support on Windows. Thanks Konstantin Zemlyak.

* Added pydoc script to ease use. Thanks Marc Abramowitz. Fixes #149.

* Fixed creating a bootstrap script on Python 3. Thanks Raul Leal. Fixes #280.

* Fixed inconsistency when having set the ``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`` env var
  with the --distribute option or the ``VIRTUALENV_USE_DISTRIBUTE`` env var.
  ``VIRTUALENV_USE_DISTRIBUTE`` is now considered again as a legacy alias.


v1.7.1.2 (2012-02-17)
---------------------

* Fixed minor issue in ``--relocatable``. Thanks, Cap Petschulat.


v1.7.1.1 (2012-02-16)
---------------------

* Bumped the version string in ``virtualenv.py`` up, too.

* Fixed rST rendering bug of long description.


v1.7.1 (2012-02-16)
-------------------

* Update embedded pip to version 1.1.

* Fix ``--relocatable`` under Python 3. Thanks Doug Hellmann.

  Napoleone. Fixes #14.

* Support creating virtualenvs directly from a Python build directory on
  Windows. Thanks CBWhiz. Fixes #139.

* Use non-recursive symlinks to fix things up for posix_local install
  scheme. Thanks michr.

* Made activate script available for use with msys and cygwin on Windows.
  Thanks Greg Haskins, Cliff Xuan, Jonathan Griffin and Doug Napoleone.
  Fixes #176.

* Fixed creation of virtualenvs on Windows when Python is not installed for
  all users. Thanks Anatoly Techtonik for report and patch and Doug
  Napoleone for testing and confirmation. Fixes #87.

* Fixed creation of virtualenvs using -p in installs where some modules
  that ought to be in the standard library (e.g. ``readline``) are actually
  installed in ``site-packages`` next to ``virtualenv.py``. Thanks Greg Haskins
  for report and fix. Fixes #167.

* Added activation script for Powershell (signed by Jannis Leidel). Many
  thanks to Jason R. Coombs.


v1.7 (2011-11-30)
-----------------

* Gave user-provided ``--extra-search-dir`` priority over default dirs for
  finding setuptools/distribute (it already had priority for finding pip).
  Thanks Ethan Jucovy.

* Updated embedded Distribute release to 0.6.24. Thanks Alex Gronholm.

* Made ``--no-site-packages`` behavior the default behavior.  The
  ``--no-site-packages`` flag is still permitted, but displays a warning when
  used. Thanks Chris McDonough.

* New flag: ``--system-site-packages``; this flag should be passed to get the
  previous default global-site-package-including behavior back.

* Added ability to set command options as environment variables and options
  in a ``virtualenv.ini`` file.

* Fixed various encoding related issues with paths. Thanks Gunnlaugur Thor Briem.

* Made ``virtualenv.py`` script executable.

* Updated embedded pip release to 1.0.2.

* Fixed #141 - Be smarter about finding pkg_resources when using the
  non-default Python interpreter (by using the ``-p`` option).

* Fixed #112 - Fixed path in docs.

* Fixed #109 - Corrected doctests of a Logger method.

* Fixed #118 - Fixed creating virtualenvs on platforms that use the
  "posix_local" install scheme, such as Ubuntu with Python 2.7.

v1.6.1 (2011-04-30)
-------------------

* Start to use git-flow.

v1.4.8
------

* Fix for Mac OS X Framework builds that use
  ``--universal-archs=intel``

* Fix ``activate_this.py`` on Windows.

* Allow ``$PYTHONHOME`` to be set, so long as you use ``source
  bin/activate`` it will get unset; if you leave it set and do not
  activate the environment it will still break the environment.

* Include pip 0.7.1


v1.4.7
------

* Include pip 0.7

  installed

* Fix problem with ``virtualenv --relocate`` when ``bin/`` has
  subdirectories (e.g., ``bin/.svn/``); from Alan Franzoni.

* If you set ``$VIRTUALENV_DISTRIBUTE`` then virtualenv will use
  Distribute by default (so you don't have to remember to use
  ``--distribute``).

v1.4.2
------

* Fix pip installation on Windows

* Fix use of stand-alone ``virtualenv.py`` (and boot scripts)

* Exclude ~/.local (user site-packages) from environments when using

v1.4
----

* Updated setuptools to 0.6c11

* Added the --distribute option

* Fixed packaging problem of support-files


v1.3.4
------

* Virtualenv now copies the actual embedded Python binary on
  Mac OS X to fix a hang on Snow Leopard (10.6).

* Fail more gracefully on Windows when ``win32api`` is not installed.

* Fix site-packages taking precedent over Jython's ``__classpath__``
  and also specially handle the new ``__pyclasspath__`` entry in
  ``sys.path``.

* Now copies Jython's ``registry`` file to the virtualenv if it exists.

* Better find libraries when compiling extensions on Windows.

* Create ``Scripts\pythonw.exe`` on Windows.

* Added support for the Debian/Ubuntu
  ``/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages`` directory.

* Set ``distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars()['LIBDIR']`` (based on
  ``sys.real_prefix``) which is reported to help building on Windows.

* Fixes for ``--python``: make it work with ``--relocatable`` and the
  symlink created to the exact Python version.


v1.3.3
------

* Use Windows newlines in ``activate.bat``, which has been reported to help
  when using non-ASCII directory names.

* Fixed compatibility with Jython 2.5b1.

* Added a function ``virtualenv.install_python`` for more fine-grained
  access to what ``virtualenv.create_environment`` does.

* Fix `a problem <https://bugs.launchpad.net/virtualenv/+bug/241581>`_
  with Windows and paths that contain spaces.

* If ``/path/to/env/.pydistutils.cfg`` exists (or
  ``/path/to/env/pydistutils.cfg`` on Windows systems) then ignore
  ``~/.pydistutils.cfg`` and use that other file instead.

* Fix ` a problem
  <https://bugs.launchpad.net/virtualenv/+bug/340050>`_ picking up
  some ``.so`` libraries in ``/usr/local``.


v1.3.2
------

* Remove the ``[install] prefix = ...`` setting from the virtualenv
  ``distutils.cfg`` -- this has been causing problems for a lot of
  people, in rather obscure ways.

* If you use a boot script it will attempt to import ``virtualenv``
  and find a pre-downloaded Setuptools egg using that.

* Added platform-specific paths, like ``/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/plat-linux2``


v1.3.1
------

* Real Python 2.6 compatibility.  Backported the Python 2.6 updates to
  ``site.py``, including `user directories
  <http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-370-per-user-site-packages-directory>`_
  (this means older versions of Python will support user directories,
  whether intended or not).

* Always set ``[install] prefix`` in ``distutils.cfg`` -- previously
  on some platforms where a system-wide ``distutils.cfg`` was present
  with a ``prefix`` setting, packages would be installed globally
  (usually in ``/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages``).

* Sometimes Cygwin seems to leave ``.exe`` off ``sys.executable``; a
  workaround is added.

* Fix ``--python`` option.

* Fixed handling of Jython environments that use a
  jython-complete.jar.


v1.3
----

* Update to Setuptools 0.6c9
* Added an option ``virtualenv --relocatable EXISTING_ENV``, which
  will make an existing environment "relocatable" -- the paths will
  not be absolute in scripts, ``.egg-info`` and ``.pth`` files.  This
  may assist in building environments that can be moved and copied.
  You have to run this *after* any new packages installed.
* Added ``bin/activate_this.py``, a file you can use like
  ``execfile("path_to/activate_this.py",
  dict(__file__="path_to/activate_this.py"))`` -- this will activate
  the environment in place, similar to what `the mod_wsgi example
  does <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/VirtualEnvironments>`_.
* For Mac framework builds of Python, the site-packages directory
  ``/Library/Python/X.Y/site-packages`` is added to ``sys.path``, from
  Andrea Rech.
* Some platform-specific modules in Macs are added to the path now
  (``plat-darwin/``, ``plat-mac/``, ``plat-mac/lib-scriptpackages``),
  from Andrea Rech.
* Fixed a small Bashism in the ``bin/activate`` shell script.
* Added ``__future__`` to the list of required modules, for Python
  2.3.  You'll still need to backport your own ``subprocess`` module.
* Fixed the ``__classpath__`` entry in Jython's ``sys.path`` taking
  precedent over virtualenv's libs.


v1.2
----

* Added a ``--python`` option to select the Python interpreter.
* Add ``warnings`` to the modules copied over, for Python 2.6 support.
* Add ``sets`` to the module copied over for Python 2.3 (though Python
  2.3 still probably doesn't work).


v1.1.1
------

* Added support for Jython 2.5.


v1.1
----

* Added support for Python 2.6.
* Fix a problem with missing ``DLLs/zlib.pyd`` on Windows.  Create
* ``bin/python`` (or ``bin/python.exe``) even when you run virtualenv
  with an interpreter named, e.g., ``python2.4``
* Fix MacPorts Python
* Added --unzip-setuptools option
* Update to Setuptools 0.6c8
* If the current directory is not writable, run ez_setup.py in ``/tmp``
* Copy or symlink over the ``include`` directory so that packages will
  more consistently compile.


v1.0
----

* Fix build on systems that use ``/usr/lib64``, distinct from
  ``/usr/lib`` (specifically CentOS x64).
* Fixed bug in ``--clear``.
* Fixed typos in ``deactivate.bat``.
* Preserve ``$PYTHONPATH`` when calling subprocesses.


v0.9.2
------

* Fix include dir copying on Windows (makes compiling possible).
* Include the main ``lib-tk`` in the path.
* Patch ``distutils.sysconfig``: ``get_python_inc`` and
  ``get_python_lib`` to point to the global locations.
* Install ``distutils.cfg`` before Setuptools, so that system
  customizations of ``distutils.cfg`` won't effect the installation.
* Add ``bin/pythonX.Y`` to the virtualenv (in addition to
  ``bin/python``).
* Fixed an issue with Mac Framework Python builds, and absolute paths
  (from Ronald Oussoren).


v0.9.1
------

* Improve ability to create a virtualenv from inside a virtualenv.
* Fix a little bug in ``bin/activate``.
* Actually get ``distutils.cfg`` to work reliably.


v0.9
----

* Added ``lib-dynload`` and ``config`` to things that need to be
  copied over in an environment.
* Copy over or symlink the ``include`` directory, so that you can
  build packages that need the C headers.
* Include a ``distutils`` package, so you can locally update
  ``distutils.cfg`` (in ``lib/pythonX.Y/distutils/distutils.cfg``).
* Better avoid downloading Setuptools, and hitting PyPI on environment
  creation.
* Fix a problem creating a ``lib64/`` directory.
* Should work on MacOSX Framework builds (the default Python
  installations on Mac).  Thanks to Ronald Oussoren.


v0.8.4
------

* Windows installs would sometimes give errors about ``sys.prefix`` that
  were inaccurate.
* Slightly prettier output.


v0.8.3
------

* Added support for Windows.


v0.8.2
------

* Give a better warning if you are on an unsupported platform (Mac
  Framework Pythons, and Windows).
* Give error about running while inside a workingenv.
* Give better error message about Python 2.3.


v0.8.1
------

Fixed packaging of the library.


v0.8
----

Initial release.  Everything is changed and new!
