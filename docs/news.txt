Changes & News
--------------

.. warning::

   Python bugfix releases 2.6.8, 2.7.3, 3.1.5 and 3.2.3 include a change that
   will cause "import random" to fail with "cannot import name urandom" on any
   virtualenv created on a Unix host with an earlier release of Python
   2.6/2.7/3.1/3.2, if the underlying system Python is upgraded. This is due to
   the fact that a virtualenv uses the system Python's standard library but
   contains its own copy of the Python interpreter, so an upgrade to the system
   Python results in a mismatch between the version of the Python interpreter
   and the version of the standard library. It can be fixed by removing
   ``$ENV/bin/python`` and re-running virtualenv on the same target directory
   with the upgraded Python.


develop (unreleased)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed readline on OS X. Thanks minrk

* Updated distribute to 0.6.30 (improves our error reporting, plus new
  distribute features and fixes). Thanks Gabriel (g2p)

* Added compatibility with multiarch Python (Python 3.3 for example). Added an
  integration test. Thanks Gabriel (g2p)

* Added ability to install distribute from a user-provided egg, rather than the
  bundled sdist, for better speed. Thanks Paul Moore.

* Make the creation of lib64 symlink smarter about already-existing symlink,
  and more explicit about full paths. Fixes #334 and #330. Thanks Jeremy Orem.

* Give lib64 site-dir preference over lib on 64-bit systems, to avoid wrong
  32-bit compiles in the venv. Fixes #328. Thanks Damien Nozay.

* Fix a bug with prompt-handling in ``activate.csh`` in non-interactive csh
  shells. Fixes #332. Thanks Benjamin Root for report and patch.

* Make it possible to create a virtualenv from within a Python
  3.3. pyvenv. Thanks Chris McDonough for the report.


1.8.2 (2012-09-06)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Updated to distribute 0.6.27.

* Fix activate.fish on OS X. Fixes #8. Thanks David Schoonover.

* Create a virtualenv-x.x script with the Python version when installing, so
  virtualenv for multiple Python versions can be installed to the same
  script location. Thanks Miki Tebeka.

* Restored ability to create a virtualenv with a path longer than 78
  characters, without breaking creation of virtualenvs with non-ASCII paths.
  Thanks, Bradley Ayers.

  Napoleone for testing and confirmation. Fixes #87.

* Fixed creation of virtualenvs using -p in installs where some modules
  that ought to be in the standard library (e.g. `readline`) are actually
  installed in `site-packages` next to `virtualenv.py`. Thanks Greg Haskins
  for report and fix. Fixes #167.

* Added activation script for Powershell (signed by Jannis Leidel). Many
  thanks to Jason R. Coombs.


1.7 (2011-11-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Gave user-provided ``--extra-search-dir`` priority over default dirs for
  finding setuptools/distribute (it already had priority for finding pip).
  Thanks Ethan Jucovy.

* Updated embedded Distribute release to 0.6.24. Thanks Alex Gronholm.

* Made ``--no-site-packages`` behavior the default behavior.  The
  ``--no-site-packages`` flag is still permitted, but displays a warning when
  used. Thanks Chris McDonough.

* New flag: ``--system-site-packages``; this flag should be passed to get the
  previous default global-site-package-including behavior back.

* Added ability to set command options as environment variables and options
  in a ``virtualenv.ini`` file.

  ``--universal-archs=intel``

* Fix ``activate_this.py`` on Windows.

* Allow ``$PYTHONHOME`` to be set, so long as you use ``source

1.4.7
~~~~~

* Include pip 0.7

  ``PATH`` contained a parenthesis


1.4.4
~~~~~

  installed

* Fix problem with ``virtualenv --relocate`` when ``bin/`` has

~~~~~

* Fix pip installation on Windows

* Fix use of stand-alone ``virtualenv.py`` (and boot scripts)

1.4
~~~

* Added the --distribute option

* Fixed packaging problem of support-files


1.3.4
~~~~~

* Virtualenv now copies the actual embedded Python binary on
  Mac OS X to fix a hang on Snow Leopard (10.6).

* Fail more gracefully on Windows when ``win32api`` is not installed.

* Fix site-packages taking precedent over Jython's ``__classpath__``
  and also specially handle the new ``__pyclasspath__`` entry in
  ``sys.path``.

* Now copies Jython's ``registry`` file to the virtualenv if it exists.

* Better find libraries when compiling extensions on Windows.

* Create ``Scripts\pythonw.exe`` on Windows.

* Added support for the Debian/Ubuntu
  ``/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages`` directory.

* Set ``distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars()['LIBDIR']`` (based on
  ``sys.real_prefix``) which is reported to help building on Windows.

* Make ``deactivate`` work on ksh

* Fixes for ``--python``: make it work with ``--relocatable`` and the
  symlink created to the exact Python version.


1.3.3
~~~~~

* Use Windows newlines in ``activate.bat``, which has been reported to help
  when using non-ASCII directory names.

* Fixed compatibility with Jython 2.5b1.

* Added a function ``virtualenv.install_python`` for more fine-grained
  access to what ``virtualenv.create_environment`` does.

* Fix `a problem <https://bugs.launchpad.net/virtualenv/+bug/241581>`_
  with Windows and paths that contain spaces.

* If ``/path/to/env/.pydistutils.cfg`` exists (or
  ``/path/to/env/pydistutils.cfg`` on Windows systems) then ignore
  ``~/.pydistutils.cfg`` and use that other file instead.

* Fix ` a problem
  <https://bugs.launchpad.net/virtualenv/+bug/340050>`_ picking up
  some ``.so`` libraries in ``/usr/local``.


1.3.2
~~~~~

* Remove the ``[install] prefix = ...`` setting from the virtualenv
  ``distutils.cfg`` -- this has been causing problems for a lot of
  people, in rather obscure ways.

* If you use a boot script it will attempt to import ``virtualenv``
  and find a pre-downloaded Setuptools egg using that.

* Added platform-specific paths, like ``/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/plat-linux2``


1.3.1
~~~~~

* Real Python 2.6 compatibility.  Backported the Python 2.6 updates to
  ``site.py``, including `user directories
  <http://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-370-per-user-site-packages-directory>`_
  (this means older versions of Python will support user directories,
  whether intended or not).

* Always set ``[install] prefix`` in ``distutils.cfg`` -- previously
  on some platforms where a system-wide ``distutils.cfg`` was present
  with a ``prefix`` setting, packages would be installed globally
  (usually in ``/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages``).

* Sometimes Cygwin seems to leave ``.exe`` off ``sys.executable``; a
  workaround is added.

* Fix ``--python`` option.

* Fixed handling of Jython environments that use a
  jython-complete.jar.


1.3
~~~

* Update to Setuptools 0.6c9
* Added an option ``virtualenv --relocatable EXISTING_ENV``, which
  will make an existing environment "relocatable" -- the paths will
  not be absolute in scripts, ``.egg-info`` and ``.pth`` files.  This
  may assist in building environments that can be moved and copied.
  You have to run this *after* any new packages installed.
* Added ``bin/activate_this.py``, a file you can use like
  ``execfile("path_to/activate_this.py",
  dict(__file__="path_to/activate_this.py"))`` -- this will activate
  the environment in place, similar to what `the mod_wsgi example
  does <http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/VirtualEnvironments>`_.
* For Mac framework builds of Python, the site-packages directory
  ``/Library/Python/X.Y/site-packages`` is added to ``sys.path``, from
  Andrea Rech.
* Some platform-specific modules in Macs are added to the path now
  (``plat-darwin/``, ``plat-mac/``, ``plat-mac/lib-scriptpackages``),
  from Andrea Rech.
* Fixed a small Bashism in the ``bin/activate`` shell script.
* Added ``__future__`` to the list of required modules, for Python
  2.3.  You'll still need to backport your own ``subprocess`` module.
* Fixed the ``__classpath__`` entry in Jython's ``sys.path`` taking
  precedent over virtualenv's libs.


1.2
~~~

* Added a ``--python`` option to select the Python interpreter.
* Add ``warnings`` to the modules copied over, for Python 2.6 support.
* Add ``sets`` to the module copied over for Python 2.3 (though Python
  2.3 still probably doesn't work).


1.1.1
~~~~~

* Added support for Jython 2.5.


1.1
~~~

* Added support for Python 2.6.
* Fix a problem with missing ``DLLs/zlib.pyd`` on Windows.  Create
* ``bin/python`` (or ``bin/python.exe``) even when you run virtualenv
  with an interpreter named, e.g., ``python2.4``
* Fix MacPorts Python
* Added --unzip-setuptools option
* Update to Setuptools 0.6c8
* If the current directory is not writable, run ez_setup.py in ``/tmp``
* Copy or symlink over the ``include`` directory so that packages will
  more consistently compile.


1.0
~~~

* Fix build on systems that use ``/usr/lib64``, distinct from
  ``/usr/lib`` (specifically CentOS x64).
* Fixed bug in ``--clear``.
* Fixed typos in ``deactivate.bat``.
* Preserve ``$PYTHONPATH`` when calling subprocesses.


0.9.2
~~~~~

* Fix include dir copying on Windows (makes compiling possible).
* Include the main ``lib-tk`` in the path.
* Patch ``distutils.sysconfig``: ``get_python_inc`` and
  ``get_python_lib`` to point to the global locations.
* Install ``distutils.cfg`` before Setuptools, so that system
  customizations of ``distutils.cfg`` won't effect the installation.
* Add ``bin/pythonX.Y`` to the virtualenv (in addition to
  ``bin/python``).
* Fixed an issue with Mac Framework Python builds, and absolute paths
  (from Ronald Oussoren).


0.9.1
~~~~~

* Improve ability to create a virtualenv from inside a virtualenv.
* Fix a little bug in ``bin/activate``.
* Actually get ``distutils.cfg`` to work reliably.


0.9
~~~

* Added ``lib-dynload`` and ``config`` to things that need to be
  copied over in an environment.
* Copy over or symlink the ``include`` directory, so that you can
  build packages that need the C headers.
* Include a ``distutils`` package, so you can locally update
  ``distutils.cfg`` (in ``lib/pythonX.Y/distutils/distutils.cfg``).
* Better avoid downloading Setuptools, and hitting PyPI on environment
  creation.
* Fix a problem creating a ``lib64/`` directory.
* Should work on MacOSX Framework builds (the default Python
  installations on Mac).  Thanks to Ronald Oussoren.


0.8.4
~~~~~

* Windows installs would sometimes give errors about ``sys.prefix`` that
  were inaccurate.
* Slightly prettier output.


0.8.3
~~~~~

* Added support for Windows.


0.8.2
~~~~~

* Give a better warning if you are on an unsupported platform (Mac
  Framework Pythons, and Windows).
* Give error about running while inside a workingenv.
* Give better error message about Python 2.3.


0.8.1
~~~~~

Fixed packaging of the library.


0.8
~~~

Initial release.  Everything is changed and new!
